# ML Platform & AI Engineering Portfolio

I design and build production oriented machine learning and AI systems with emphasis on reliability, latency, evaluation, and infrastructure. My background spans high dimensional indexing, vector search, data systems, and performance critical engineering, with recent focus on ML deployment, MLOps, and scalable inference architectures.

This repository serves as a structured entry point to selected projects that reflect real world engineering concerns rather than notebook only experimentation.

## Projects

### Python Service Template  
Reusable production oriented Python service foundation for ML and AI systems.

Repository: https://github.com/fatemeh-zardbani/python-service-template

Highlights:

• FastAPI service skeleton designed for inference workloads  
• Clear separation of runtime and development dependencies  
• Pytest based test suite for API validation  
• Ruff linting for code quality enforcement  
• Dockerized runtime for reproducible deployment  
• GitHub Actions CI pipeline for automated testing and linting  

Purpose:

A minimal but production disciplined template used as the base for subsequent ML services and model deployment projects.

Status: In progress

Focus:

• Model loading and version management  
• Structured request validation  
• Batch and single prediction flows  
• Observability and metrics  
• Containerized deployment patterns  

---

### Feature Pipeline & Data Validation  
Status: Planned

Focus:

• Batch data ingestion and transformation  
• Data quality validation and expectation checks  
• Reproducible feature generation  
• Backfill and reprocessing workflows  
• Training dataset lineage

## Engineering Principles

Across projects, I prioritize:

• Reproducibility and deterministic workflows  
• Explicit evaluation and measurement  
• Latency and resource efficiency  
• Clear system boundaries and interfaces  
• Production realistic tooling and deployment discipline
